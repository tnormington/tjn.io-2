I built the USB website with Drupal 8 and React. It is a public facing website used by the USB Implementorâ€™s Forum to post events, resources, articles, etc. A technically impressive piece of this website is the product listing. The list is about 11k products, it is searchable, sortable, and filterable to a granular level.
